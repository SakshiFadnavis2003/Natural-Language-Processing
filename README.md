# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Welcome to the Natural Language Processing (NLP) repository! This project explores various techniques and models used in natural language processing. The goal is to showcase different NLP tasks, techniques, and applications through a collection of projects and experiments.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a series of projects and experiments related to natural language processing. It includes examples of text classification, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and more.

## Features

- **Text Classification**: Projects demonstrating techniques for classifying text into predefined categories.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Examples of sentiment analysis to determine the sentiment expressed in text.
- **Named Entity Recognition**: Techniques for identifying and classifying entities in text.
- **Text Generation**: Projects on text generation using models like RNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers.
- **Language Models**: Implementation and exploration of pre-trained language models and their applications.

## Getting Started
